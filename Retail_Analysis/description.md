# Retail Analysis


### Objective 
The objective of this project is to answer the question of how the transaction history of customers/consumers can give insight into consumersâ€™ purchasing habits and also predict the products consumers might be interested in buying in the future. This kind of information can be used to align business decisions and also to understand which consumers are most valuable to the retail store, along with other essential insights.

### Approach
We have explored the following methods to do an in-depth analysis of the dataset.

1. Customer Segmentation based on value. (Value based Segmentation). Here value can be revenue, completed transactions , family members etc.  
2. Hierarchical Clustering using a dendrogram method available at SciPy.  
3. Two     step cluster analysis: This method identifies groupings by running pre clustering first and then by running hierarchical methods.
4. Recommendation     System based on collaborating filtering to recommend nth item based on (n-1) previously purchased items.   
5. Apply the analysis methods performed of the Online-Retail dataset on the     ces_hybrid_real_world dataset.
